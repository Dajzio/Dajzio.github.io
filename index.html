                  <img src="IT2.png" width="300" height="250" style='float:right' ; />
                <p2>Computer Science is the future of the world <br>
                     as it appears in every aspect of life. Beyond any recall, <br>
                      it is the fastest-growing part of the economy along with <br>
                    having a substantial influence on other sectors of  <br>
                    economics. For as long as I can remember I wanted to be <br>
                     part of it since being capable of creating something <br>
                     out of nothing fascinated me a lot. We have to face <br>
                     the truth â€“ without computers, we could find living a <br>
                     tremendous task. The world of computers is expanding <br>
                     day by day. We cannot do anything about it. As adolescents, <br> 
                     we can only understand this dimension as best as possible.</p2>
